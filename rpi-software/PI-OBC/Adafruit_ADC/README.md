# DEPRECATED LIBRARY: Adafruit Python MCP3008

This library has been deprecated! We are leaving this up for historical and research purposes but archiving the repository.

We are now only supporting the use of our CircuitPython libraries for use with Python.

Please see the CircuitPython MCP3xxx library for using the MCP3008: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MCP3xxx/

Python code to use the MCP3008 analog to digital converter with a Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone black.

## Installation

To install the library from source (recommended) run the following commands on a Raspberry Pi or other Debian-based OS system:

    sudo apt-get install git build-essential python-dev
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_MCP3008.git
    cd Adafruit_Python_MCP3008
    sudo python setup.py install

Alternatively you can install from pip with:

    sudo pip install adafruit-mcp3008

Note that the pip install method **won't** install the example code.
